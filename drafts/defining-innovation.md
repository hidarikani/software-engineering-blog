# Innovation Is Also Execution

 I am interested in innovation and how it happens and I think that it's a very broad term that doesn't have a short definition similarly to quality. I would like to try to define one face of innovation that I'm interested in. One and three explanation of innovation is a novel idea something that remixes existing ideas but Chris it's a new combination that nobody has tried before. However, there's a missing piece to it often when you have a novel idea and you presented to the world you are unfortunately greeted with skepticism. If you're like you and you tell it to your close friends or coworkers that you trust if you're lucky, they will see some benefits in it and reinforce your belief that it might work. But often people just  in a different mind in instant and thinking about other things and don't really resonate with your idea. This is normal because your idea might be actually not that smart and might really not work so so some skeptic ism is in order. What is interesting  That when you're greeted with skeptic ism but you're still believe in your idea you have only one thing left. You need to try it and make it and that way you will know for sure whether the skeptics were right or whether you were right and that's when the magic happens when the sceptical idea becomes reality, people are called geniuses and successful businessman.
