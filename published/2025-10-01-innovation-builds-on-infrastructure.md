# Innovation Builds on Infrastructure

Successful applications often build on existing infrastructure.

A well-known example is Amazon, which initially leveraged the postal service’s logistics network to deliver products efficiently. Interestingly, postal systems were in a strong position to innovate in online commerce — but it took a startup to make that leap.

Another example is Instagram, which grew rapidly thanks to the widespread adoption of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras.

Uber followed a similar pattern. It built its service on top of several mature technologies — GPS, Google Maps, and mobile internet — which together made real-time ride-hailing possible.

Now generative AI seems to be following the same path:

✅ Models like GitHub Copilot build on the vast repositories of open-source code hosted on GitHub.

✅ Text-to-image models likely draw on billions of tagged images from across the internet — social media, blogs, and image-sharing platforms — much of which can be discovered through tools like Google Image Search.

✅ And text-to-video models are probably learning from countless publicly available or tagged videos hosted on platforms such as YouTube.
